# LeetCode Problems

This repository holds various leetcode problems.  

They are identified by their numbers and can easily be searched with:
[https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/]
I recommend sorting all problem and select some HARD ones.


Some of the problems are from Google/Amazon that users post, usually there is a link to problem in the file.  


Usually the code is self-explanatory and is only required to run. 
Sometimes some testing is implemented. 
Sometimes several approaches are used to compare complexity.





Have as much fun reading as I had solving them :)
